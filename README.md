c++ Assignment 3
Inheritence

Compilation:
	navigate to the folder in which the below mentioned .cpp files are stored (assuming that by you reading this, the tarball is already extracted). Typing 'make' will compile the program, or 'make run' (which will both compile and run the program) - recommended

	Note : g++ or clang++ must be used for compilation.

Execution: 
	As mentioned before, this assignment can be run by typing 'make run' in terminal.

	if this is not wanted, then after compilation type './executable' in terminal

FileList:
